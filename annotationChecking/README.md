# annotationChecking
### Marcus Viscardi, 2025-01-28

One of the requests from the editors was to ensure that the gene names used in
our manuscript were up-to-date and accurate. To do this, I pulled the most recent
version of the gene annotations from WormBase.org, and I am going to compare those
to the genes in the set of annotations originally used in the manuscript.

The version we pulled was *C. elegans* WS295, which is the most recent version of
the annotations as of Jan 28, 2025 (looks like it was uploaded in November 2024)

This will require linking those based on the WBGENE ID, which is a unique identifier!
