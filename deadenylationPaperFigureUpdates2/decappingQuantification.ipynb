    "Check out `README.md` for a more overarching view of what is happening here.\n",

    "Specifically, the goal is to produce comparisons of true full-length reads (spanning out to the TSS) and the reads that have cleavages near their stop codons (and the other reads).\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest choice to make here, is if we want to manually annotate a subset of genes to look at for this, or if we should rather look into a reference-based approach. I think the reference-based approach is likely to be more robust, but it will require a big up-front investment in time to get the reference data in a usable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I think I will start with the manual annotation approach, as it will be quicker to get started with and will allow me to get a better feel for the data and the types of things that I will be looking for."

    "The general idea is that the increase in reads near the TSS when we break NMD with smg-5 or smg-6 is due to the vast increase of the precursor NMD species. This would be expected if NMD targets were undergoing typical end of life cycle deadenylation and decapping.\n",
